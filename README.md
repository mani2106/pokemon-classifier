# Pokemon Classifier

This repo is a part of my study in deep learning with [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai), this app uses this template [repo](https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3).  thanks to them for the starter code and the [fast ai MOOC](https://course.fast.ai/) for making it easy to build deep learning models, and also the creator of this [dataset](https://kaggle.com/mrgravelord/complete-pokemon-image-dataset) for putting up a curated dataset.

I have also hosted this web app on heroku, Check it out [here](https://pokemon-classifier.herokuapp.com). 

I will be adding a notebook explaining, how I built the model very soon.
